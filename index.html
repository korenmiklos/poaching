# A model of sales managers
Why do market intermediares exist? The key idea is that sales managers help determine noncodifabile match quality based on experience with both parties.

Consider the case of the real estate market first.
## Real estate brokers
To generate a sale, a buyer $x$ and seller $y$ has to meet and aggree to transact. Both buyers and sellers have noncodifiable knowledge about their match preferences: what are the hidden features of the apartment, what does the buyer like? 

Because of these noncodifiable features, the viability of a match can only be determined if both $x$ and $y$ are known. To figure out whether $(x,y)$ is a match takes a cost $c$. For example, the buyer has to view the apartment.

Because there are many buyers and many sellers, it is not feasible to test all possible matches for quality. This would take $cN^2$ cost, where $N$ is the number of sellers. (Assumed to be the same as the number of buyers.)

Real estate brokers also pay this cost to find out match quality, but they can also keep apartments (or buyers, I will ignore the two-sided nature for now) on their inventory. This is essentially a search model with recall.

Consider a broker who has $n$ apartments on her inventory. It takes a cost $f$ to put an apartment on inventory. She needs to talk to the seller, establish rapport etc.

A new buyer approaches this broker. The probability that he will be a good match for a random seller is $1-q$. The probability of finding an apartment via this broker is $1-q^n$, increasing in $n$, but at a diminishing rate.

If there are $k$ buyers approaching this broker, her expected profit will be
$$
k(1-q^n)-(kc+f)n.
$$
We have normalized the commission from a sale to 1 (WLOG) and assumed that $n\gg k$ so that the inventory does not decrease subsantially after successful sales. (This is an even better assumption when matches are non-exclusive: a seller can satisfy multiple buyers.)

Note that while $c$ has to be paid for each buyer (they have to view the apartment), the initial cost can be spread across multiple buyers.

Differentiating wrt $n$ and denoting $q=e^{-\lambda}$ gives the FOC
$$
\lambda e^{-\lambda n^*} = c+f/k,
$$
$$
n^* = \frac 1\lambda
	\ln\frac 
	{\lambda}
	{c+f/k}.
$$
The optimal number of apartments to keep on inventory is decreasing in the cost of figuring out match quality and increasing in the number of buyers.

### Why do not buyers seek out apartments on their own? 
Private buyers have access to the same technology, but for them $k=1$. If connecting to sellers is costly or if there are many potential buyers per broker, the optimal inventory of a broker is much larger than the optimal search strategy of a private buyer. 

(In practice, brokers can specialize in different types of apartments, essentially increasing the likelihood of a good match, but here the difference between brokers and private buyers seems second order.)

## Business-to-business sales
We can think of B2B sales like real estate brokerage, but with different parameters. Finding an initial contact is not that costly ($f$ is low), but figuring out match quality is much more expensive ($c$ is high).

As a result, there are no dedicated B2B brokerages. (But see trade fairs.) However, managers who *happen* to have many potential clients (or sellers) on their "inventory," are more valuable. That is, past experience of linking with buyers is valued in the market.
