Worker $i$ is moving from firm $A$ to firm $B$. How does client $C$ of $A$ decide whether to also move to $B$?

The value of $C$ of the relationship with $A$ depends on firm observables (number of employees in different occupation categories, productivity), plus a client-specific skill of a key worker $i$, $\xi_{iC}$.

The value of firm $j$ for client $c$ with key worker $i$ is
$$
\beta x_j + \xi_{ic}.
$$
The term $\xi$ is unobserved for both $i$ and $c$ and can only be learned after $c$ works with $i$. At other firms, you can only guess that it's drawn from a distribution $F(\xi|x_j)$. 

If person $i$ leaves, the risk is that the new hire will have a lower $\xi$. If I move with the person, I can keep her $\xi$.
