# Poaching 
- Conditional on not having sold to this firm before the worker arrived, what is the hazard of starting to sell to it?
	- Depending on whether the firm was a customer of the sending firm (`firm1_sold_before`)
		- Only use these. Other firms are selected in the fact that they are buyers of firm 2
		- We need a better control group of buyers. Buyers not among those of firm 1 are, by definition, those of firm 2 and will have an artifically large effect.
		- We can fill in the zeros when merging the VAT. There are many buyers which are not served by either firm 1 or firm 2.
	- And on whether the moving worker is a sales manager

## Pseudo stata code
```
forvalues i=1/2 {
	egen firm`i'_sold_before = max(cond(event_time<=100, sell`i', 0)), by(firm_id1 firm_id2 index)
}

# generate disjoint categories
generate byte skilled_nonsales = pro0 | uni0
generate byte sales = pro1 | uni1 | mgr1
# some firm pairs have multiple occupations moving
replace skilled_nonsales = 0 if sales

levelsof event_time, local(ts)
foreach t in `ts' {
	generate byte event_`t' = (event_time==`t')
	foreach X in skilled_nonsales sales {
		generate byte `X'_`t' = `X'*event_`t'
	}
}

# what event time should be used as the baseline?
# no baseline is need for interacted dummies: there may also be selection: firms which receive sales managers are already more likely to sell to same firm

regress sell2 event_?? event_??? skilled_nonsales_* sales_* i.year [fw=n] if firm1_sold_before & !firm2_sold_before, cluster(firm_id1)
# also report the t-test of differences in event time effects
```

## Notes
Whenever the right-hand side is an interaction, functional form of the left-hand side matters. Estimating a linear probability model may not lead the same results as a logit, probit, cloglog, etc. When running a hazard model like here, my preferred specification is `cloglog` as it corresponds to a proportional hazard model: $\Pr(n_t>0) = 1-e^{-e^{\beta X_t}}$, which means a hazard rate of $e^{\beta X_t}$. So if $X$ is the arrival of a sels manager, the interpretation of $\beta$ is the *proportional change in hazard* of selling after the arrivel of a sales manager.
